# MathsLib
C++ maths library for 3D graphics and game development

Simple maths library I used in my past 3D graphics/game projects (taken from my old 3D engine: http://ngene.wikidot.com ). My idea is to update it to more modern C++, update coding style, optimize it and test.

To use it, just add the source and header files into your project (or build a lib and link against it).
